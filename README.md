Overview:
In this project, we'll create a simple real-time chat application using Flask, a Python web framework, and Socket.IO, a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.

Prerequisites:
Basic understanding of Python.
Python installed on your system.
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Familiarity with Flask and Socket.IO is helpful but not required.
Steps:
Setting Up the Environment:

Create a new directory for your project.
Set up a virtual environment using virtualenv.
Activate the virtual environment.
Setting Up Flask Application:

Create a Python file (e.g., app.py) for your Flask application.
Import necessary modules (Flask, render_template, request, json, Flask-SocketIO).
Initialize your Flask application and configure Socket.IO.
Creating HTML Templates:

Create HTML templates for your chat application.
Design templates for the chat room, messages display, and input form.
Implementing Client-Side Logic:

Write JavaScript code to handle sending and receiving messages.
Establish a connection with the Socket.IO server.
Handle events like sending messages, receiving messages, and updating the UI.
